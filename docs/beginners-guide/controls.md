# Controls

Now that we have a basic understanding of the structure of the game, let's take a look at the controls.

## Keyboard/Mouse

Don't use a keyboard or mouse. It's not fun. It's not enjoyable. It's not worth it. If you're serious about playing the game, get a steering wheel. You'll thank me later.

## Controller

The game is barely playable with a controller. But, if you must, here are some basic ways to set up your controller:  
Set up your controller by going to `Settings > Assetto Corsa > Controls`.

Firstly, set the `Input method` to `Gamepad`.  
If you're using a PS4 controller, you can use the "DS4Windows" software to emulate an Xbox controller. This will make it easier to set up your controls.  
If you're using an Xbox controller or PS5 controller, you can skip this step.

## Steering Wheel

The game is best played with a steering wheel. Here are some basic ways to set up your steering wheel:  
Set up your steering wheel by going to `Settings > Assetto Corsa > Controls`.

Firstly, set the `Input method` to `Wheel`.  
Bind the axes and buttons required to play the game. The game has a lot of options for Force Feedback, so you can tweak it to your liking.  
If you have a shifter, you can also bind the gears to the shifter.

A good starting point for any wheel is to search for your wheel and `Assetto Corsa` in Google. You'll find a lot of people who have shared their settings for your wheel. This will give you a good starting point to tweak the settings to your liking.
