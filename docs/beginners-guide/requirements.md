# Requirements

Before we get started, there's a few things that we absolutely need.

## Hardware

To run Assetto Corsa and its mods, you'll need a decent gaming PC. Here's a rough idea of what you'll need:

- **GPU:** High-end Nvidia GTX (1660, 1070, etc) or AMD equivalent.
- **CPU:** Intel i5 9th gen CPU or AMD equivalent.
- **RAM:** 16 GB DDR4.

Along with that, we also need a game pad of some sort. A controller is barely usable, but a wheel is highly recommended.  
A good starter wheel is the [Thrustmaster T300RS GT Edition](https://www.google.com/search?q=thrustmaster+t300rs+gt+edition), which is an amazing wheel. A more budget option is the Logitech G29, but it has less [Force Feedback](/docs/terminology#force-feedback) and performs worse, especially during drifting.

## Software

Before we can start playing, we need to get the game and some essential tools.
